## How to use

1. Clone the project locally
    ```shell

    ```
2. Switch to the project directory
    ```shell

3. Ensure you use Node 10

    The project doesn't build with Node 12 and 14 at least on Linux.

    npm start
    ```
    If you are using `nvm`, run
    ```shell
    nvm install 10
    nvm use 10
    ```
4. Install npm dependencies, then start the project
    ```shell
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
5. Use a browser to access, the default port is `3100`: http://localhost:3100
